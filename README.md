# E-sheet
E sheet is an app that makes taking attendance of students easy and convenient. With e sheet, you can create and manage attendance records using your deviceâ€™s hotspot. You can also share and export the records to other formats.
- creating this app make taking attendance is very simple and fast way
- one of most important problem that faculty not providing access to database so I created a new method to fill data whiteout using this database, and find best method to connect between devices.
- I have learned clean architecture and how to separate component of the project and other skills like responsive screen , local database management, accessing phone storage and providing required permissions .
